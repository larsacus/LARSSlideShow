##LARSSlideShow 1.0

###Description
I created this slideshow plugin a looong time ago while unemployed and just out of school.  It's been sitting unused on an old webserver until now. It was inspired by a photography site's flash photo slideshow.  I wanted that same look on my site, but didn't care much for flash.  This will run on any browser that supports javascript, which includes all iDevices and droids.

This is meant to take up an entire page, save for the header and footers.

This could easily be adapted to use jQuery and very much needs some adapting to newer versions of MooTools.

###Requirements
- MooTools with Fx (Included as submodule)

###Installation
- Download and copy LARSSlideShow.js to wherever it is you put scripts
- Include script in `<head>` - `<script rel="text/javascript" src="scripts/LARSSlideShow.js"></script>`
- Create a container with an id of `body_wrapper` that contains elements with IDs `footer`, `header`
- Create the slideshow `img` element with an ID named `slideshow`, as well as a container div for it with the ID `slideshow_border`
- Change the settings in the .js file to point to the correct images with the correct background colors you would like to be displayed for each image:

```javascript
options: {
	imageContainer: 'slideshow',
	imageNum: 1,
	images: [
		'images/1.jpg',
		'images/6.jpg',
		'images/2.jpg',
		'images/3.jpg',
		'images/5.jpg',
		'images/4.jpg'
	],
	colors:[
	'#1D3362',
	'#db5278',
	'#681213',
	'#445289',
	'#b79f71',
	'#bc943c',
	],
	img_El:[],
	delay:4500
},
```

- Add a window event in `<head>` for `domready` that creates the slideshow event:

```javascript
<script rel="text/javascript">
	window.addEvent('domready', function() {
    var newSlideshow = new LARSlideShow();
    window.addEvent('resize', newSlideshow.adjustBodyHeight);
    window.addEvent('domready', newSlideshow.fadeInBanner);
    if(Browser.Engine.trident)
      window.addEvent('domready', newSlideshow.adjustBodyHeight);
    else
      window.addEvent('load', newSlideshow.adjustBodyHeight);
  });
</script>
```

####Basic Page Structure

```html
<div id="header">
</div>
<div id="body_wrapper" style="overflow: hidden;">
	<div id="slideshow_border">
		<img id="slideshow" src="images/1.jpg" />
	</div>
</div>
<div id="footer">
</div>
```

###License
I would love attribution and a link to this page on GitHub [here](http://github.com/larsacus/LARSSlideShow), but it is not required.
